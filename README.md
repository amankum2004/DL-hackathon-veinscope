Ever had a doctor examine your eye veins? Turns out, those veins can reveal early signs of various medical conditions.

Introducing Casca — our deep learning-based solution built during the hackathon. Casca segments eye veins from real-world eye images and extracts meaningful medical insights from their structure.

We took on the challenge of adapting nnUNet, a model originally designed for medical imaging (like MRI/CT scans), to work on real-life eye images. With some clever tweaks, we made it work — and the results were promising!

It was an intense 36-hour journey packed with learning, debugging, and innovation. While I hoped for an even better outcome, the experience was incredibly rewarding and insightful.

Huge thanks to my amazing teammates — Md Farhan, Gaurav Kushwaha, ROHIT Sailpar, Aman Kumar, and Pranav Raj. It was pleasure working with all of you, and I look forward to many more collaboration in the future.

A special shoutout to Prof. Aditya Nigam and Prof. Arnav Bhavsar for organizing such a fantastic opportunity!
